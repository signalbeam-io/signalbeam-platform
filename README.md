# SignalBeam  

> **Illuminate your systems with unified observability**  
SignalBeam is an open-source observability platform designed for modern applications, IoT, and edge environments. It enables **log monitoring, distributed tracing, metrics collection, and edge analytics** under a single unified "beam" metaphor.  

SignalBeam is lightweight, cloud-native, and designed to scale seamlessly from a **single edge device** to **enterprise-wide monitoring**.

## üåü Capabilities  

- **Log Monitoring (SignalBeam Core)** ‚Äì Collect, aggregate, and search logs from apps, containers, and on-prem systems.  
- **Edge Monitoring (SignalBeam Edge)** ‚Äì Stream logs and metrics from IoT devices and gateways.  
- **Distributed Tracing (SignalBeam Trace)** ‚Äì Trace requests across microservices and hybrid environments.  
- **Metrics (SignalBeam Metrics)** ‚Äì Collect time-series metrics for performance and capacity planning.  
- **Security Analytics** ‚Äì Detect anomalies and correlate events at edge or central nodes.  
- **GDPR & Compliance Ready** ‚Äì Designed with data locality and privacy in mind.
