# SignalBeam  

> **Illuminate your systems with unified observability**  
SignalBeam is an open-source observability platform designed for modern applications, IoT, and edge environments. It enables **log monitoring, distributed tracing, metrics collection, and edge analytics** under a single unified "beam" metaphor.  

SignalBeam is lightweight, cloud-native, and designed to scale seamlessly from a **single edge device** to **enterprise-wide monitoring**.
